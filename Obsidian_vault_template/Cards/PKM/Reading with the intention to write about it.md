# Reading with the intention to write about it

Idea taken from Ahrens^[[Ahrens (2017). *How to take smart notes: one simple technique to boost writing, learning and thinking: for students, academics and nonfiction book writers*.](zotero://select/items/_HL8T86FE)].

Reading with the intention to write about it *provides focus*, because I will automatically approach a text with *questions* like
- What is the main message?
- How does the message relate to what I already know?
    - Does it support/contradict/correct my own positions?
- How can I frame the message for others?

Also, it ensures that I at least take some short notes that I want to process later, such that I can write about it.
**Approach the reading with the idea that the only thing I will remember in 5 years are the notes that I take about the text now.**


## Expanding the idea

The scope of this idea can be extended to more than just reading texts, listening to lectures or presentations, or watching videos. *It can be applied to life:* [[Living with the intention to write about it]].
