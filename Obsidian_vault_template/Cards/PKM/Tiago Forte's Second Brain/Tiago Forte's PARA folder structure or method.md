# Tiago Forte's PARA folder structure

> [!Summary]
> A action-oriented folder system that can be used across all platforms like note apps, file system, etc.

- **0 INBOX**: New stuff goes in here first (Capture) and is put to the correct place later (Organize).
- **1 PROJECTS**: Currently active short-term efforts or projects. Put paused or cancelled projects into archives.
- **2 AREAS**: Long-term responsibility, interest, etc.
- **3 RESOURCES**: Storage of ideas, summaries, inspirations that might come handy in the future.
- **4 ARCHIVES**: Archived projects, areas or resources. Use this to keep the other areas clean.

"PARA isn’t a filing system; it’s a production system."

Goals:
- Keeping *Projects* and *Areas* clean, such that only currently relevant folders are contained.
- Storing everything that might be useful later in *Resources*.
- Keeping all old things out of sight in *Archives*.
