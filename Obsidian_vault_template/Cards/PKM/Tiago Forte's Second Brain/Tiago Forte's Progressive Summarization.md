# Tiago Forte's Progressive Summarization

This method creates almost no mo work, but ensures that consumed texts, books, etc. can be recalled much easier.

1. *Read the book on a tablet*, where you can *highlight during reading*. I recommend using Zotero.
2. *Extract all highlighted text and paste it into a note*. This is the minimum one should do and it takes almost no time. When you want to remember the content of the book, simply look at these extracted highlights, which is much faster than reading the whole book again. The next "compression" steps are not necessary. They can either be done directly (in case the book is very important) or each time the summary is needed again, such that one leaves the summary in a better shape every time it is needed.
3.  Mark the important text *bold*.
4. *Highlight* parts of the bold passages.
5. Add a *summary in your own words*. This step was added by me.
6. Add an *executive summary*, consisting of 3-5 bullet points.

Additionally, add notes (cards: Zettel) for each idea that resonates with you. These cards are stored not next to the book summary, but within the slip-box (Zettelkasten).


## Other technniques
- [[Dann Berg's method for recalling books]] is very similar, but it suggests to always do the complete summarization. Actually, I thinks that makes more sense - at least for books that I think have a real value for me now or in the future.
