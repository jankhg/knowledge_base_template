[[My Obsidian Conventions]]

## PKM systems
With systems I mean full blown systems that are thought through completely. Systems developed by others can be a great starting point or provide inspiration. However, my own system will most likely not be an exact copy of someone else' system.

## PKM concepts
*With concepts I mean small elements that provide a certain, specific value to my PKM.*

- [[Reading with the intention to write about it]] automatically provides focus.
- [[Dann Berg's method for recalling books]] is great for books, scientific papers and in principle also for websites.
- [[Tiago Forte's Progressive Summarization]] is very similar, but even simpler.
- [[PKM folder systems]]
