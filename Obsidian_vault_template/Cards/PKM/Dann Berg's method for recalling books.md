## Annotated notes

1. Read the book on a **digital reader and highlight interesting passages** while reading. This does not disturb the flow.
2. After finishing reading, Take all highlights into one Note and **annotate**:
    - Imagine that you are reading these notes years later, when you'll have forgotten most of it.
    - Mark very important things **bold** (use rarely)
    - Mark not so important things *italic* (use more often).
3. **Summarize**
    - Add a section *Summary* at the very top of the note
    - **Summarize in own words in bullet form, with no more than 3-5 bullets.**
    - The summary is a message to my future self.

> [!Info]
> When *summarizing fiction*, do not focus on the plot (can be found on Wikipedia), but on themes or structure.
> - What did I like?
> - What not?

## Comparison with similar methods

- [[Tiago Forte's Progressive Summarization]] is very similar, but in a way even simpler, because it says that the first two steps are enough at first. The additional highlighting an summarization is then done later when needed. The benefit of Dann Berg's method is, that the book content is still fresh in my mind which makes it easier to write a summary in my own words.
